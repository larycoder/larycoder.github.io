        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div id="basic_information">
          <h2>Profile</h2>
          <p>
            Hi guy, my name is Le Nhu Chu Hiep. The owner of this site. I am 100% Vietnamese, was born in Hanoi
            and still live in Hanoi, VN. I joined to University of Science and Technology of Hanoi following
            Information Communication Information program since 2017. I am good at math and can code C/C++, 
            python and Java. My favourite working platform is Arch linux and Gaming platform is windows 10. About
            game, I used to play Fifa online and Dota 2 (now is only dota 2). My love sport is soccer but cannot 
            control ball well :(
          </p>
          <h2>Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            I has only 1 rule for almost everything in my daily life: Simple as possible. But that is not all
            my philosophy. During living and studying time. I concluded 3 things:
            <ul>
              <li>Clarify what you will do</li>
              <li>Done everything step by step</li>
              <li>Log out job process</li>
            </ul>
            Let me explain: 3 conclusion I recognized base on 1 philosophy - simple as possible. First, <strong>clarify
            what you will do</strong> defines the target of job. And all your task should be homogeneous with that target.
            So it let your job simple with only 1 target at a time. Advise is that you should work for 1 target only and
            don't lose it in middle. Second, <strong>Done everything step by step</strong> help you outline strategy of
            the job. It is easy to track and follow. Sometimes, your strategy is not best, non optimized. But the most
            importance that it simple for you to following your plan. After that, you can improve it through time depending
            on the skelenton that you has ready done. Final, <strong>Log out job process</strong> is newest law I found out.
            You can use it or not, but it help me a lot on reload the process into my short memory in each time working.
            To make it clearly, imagine when you do 1 job for multiple of days. Each day, you did part of job. Then next time,
            you need to remember the part of work has not yet done. And you can accidentally forgot somethign. To solve this
            problem and make process simple, I will log out my job, my idea, what I did and what I intended to do. In next day,
            I will use that log to remind me the state that I stopped before. It speed up my job a lot.
          </p>
          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            I has 2 type of hobbies, working hobbies and entertainment hobbies. Sound strange, let make some detail:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Working hobbies</strong><p>
                Working hobbies is my habit and my favourite duing building something. About my habit when do the job,
                I am guy who always want to understand what I do. So sometimes, during my work, I prefer to do it from
                scratch or at least know what happend if need to use framework. It can be good for studying but really
                bad on industry because usually reinvent the wheel cause your project slow down. So during my project,
                I try to harmonize them (focus on build the main task - from scratch - base on framework exited). Feel
                complicate, me too. Jumping to my favourite, I like cloud and the benefit of its service. In other words,
                I like the distributed system and always used opportunity to study about it. But I like mathematics also,
                and I has some knowledge in machine learning domain. Too greedy, yeah, I think so.
              </p></li>
              <li><strong>Entertainment hobbies</strong><p>
                You can mention me as a weaboo. I like japanese animation, cartoon movie and comic. I approached them
                very soon when I was young. So during my free time or even my working time, I often watch anime, read
                manga. It is no shame to talk about it. I feel good with my interesting. No problem !
